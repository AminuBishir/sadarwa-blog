This WebApp is a multi-user blog that allows users to make post as well as edit or delete their posts. Logged in users can also comment and like other peoples' posts.
To be able to run this WebApp locally, one will need to have the following:

1. Install python 2.7.x
2. Install AppEngine (the cli or the launcher gui)
3. Install jinja2 module (if it didn't come with your python installation, though it does most of the time)

To deploy the app, you need to:
1. create ab account with Google AppEngine
2. create a project (bearing the same name) on Google's Developer Console
3. Click on deploy (if you're using the launcher) or **gcloud app deploy** (if you're using cli)
